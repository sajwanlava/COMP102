Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
For a while I couldn't get the shape classes to connect to the shape implements class because I had
been missing the "implements shape" bit on the public class shapeName{. The move wasn't working properly and
it was moving the shapes to a random position off the window and therefore to fix it I added a simple if statement
which checked that if the click was on the shape it would then move to the selected position by minusing the pressedX from 
the changeX.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
There was a lot more practice with arrayLists which I appreciated. It was much easier this time round
as most the assignment was based on this syntax so I got a lot of practice. I approached this assignment using my knowlege from the 
last assignment to help with arrayLists and using assignment 6 - the miniPaint. 

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
I worked on this with Rachel Salazar whom is also in COMP102. I also felt this was quite a hard assignment to start,
which is to be expected with the last assignment of the course. However, when I did pas the initial few methods in the main miniDraw class
the assignment became much more doable and easier to approach.
