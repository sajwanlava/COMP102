Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
I didn't encounter anything luckily. 

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
I came into this assignment knowing a bit more that last tri. It was easier and I read the tasks slower to have enough time to absorb them.

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
Not at this time thanks.
