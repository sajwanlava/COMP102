Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
I had an error with the completion horizontal lines for opening and closing prices in the stock analyser tool program.
What I didn't realise was that I was getting the initial x parameter wrong as was looping through the while loop
first and printing the last x value defined. To spot this mistake earlier next time I will specifically just
focus on how the loop runs through each command and then look at the coding outside of the while.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
The UI draw methods were easier to use as similar things were drawn in the last symbol program. 
However I had never used UI.drawString before so that was new.

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
It was a nice amount of challenging.
