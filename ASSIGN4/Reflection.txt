Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
In the second core I initialised the row equal to num in the for loop and then wrote that row would be row--.
However this didn't work for ages because I didn't set num as decreasing either. To make this easier next time
I shall write out my code on paper to easily match the variables and understand from a different view what my code
is doing.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
Had a lot of difficulties with the second core, but to make it easier for me to understand I
decided to use a nested for loop. It was easier this time because I actually understood what I 
was doing.

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
Nope.
