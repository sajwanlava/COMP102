Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
Couldn't get the core 3 working initially and had to change the word.equals to become word.contains for it to work. 
Next time I'll consider this syntax earlier for my code to work. 
However there is a bug still in that code and it bothers me and I can't seem to find where I'm going wrong.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
Used next methods similar to the earlier assignments. It was easier to approach and use this time because
I know which type of next method goes with which type of data being inputted. I also had more practice
in this syntax due to the earlier assignments which helped me a lot this time. 

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
If you have any idea how to fix my weird code in core 3 of classtimes please help. It occurs when I type a room that doesn't
exist, but if the letters are similar to another word in the file it will print out all those. I think it's to do with the 
word.contains, however if I use word.equals my code completely doesn't work.
