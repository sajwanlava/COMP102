Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
The pac man arc took me ages to input in the code as I didn't realise that the last coordinate actually
stood for the angle of the arc. I fixed this by looking at the documentation. Next time I will access the 
documentation faster.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
The user input was very similar to past things I had done and it was easier to do because I knew it.

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
Mitsubishi is so difficult.
