Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
In my frogSnakeGame program, I have direction=dir in my frog method. However in the rest
of the program, I had been typing dir, instead of direction and this took me ages to 
figure out why it was throwing an error. To fix this next time I have to think about the 
simple syntax errors instead of complex ones first in order to check that my basic coding
is correct.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
Used this. syntax much like the tricolourflagdrawer. This time it was easier
because I knew how it worked and I was confident with it.

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
Even though we had forever to do it I ran out of time so my submission code game is
weak this week. I'm sorry.
