Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
My images would merge, but it is only shown after making the image darker or contrasting it.
Therefore I didn't really fix it and was wondering whether there was a way to fix it?

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
It was similar to the basic concept of normal Arrays, however with a 2D element to it. Therefore
it was fairly okay to understand the concepts to this type of coding. I approached it as I would
a normal array with another layer added on. 

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
While understanding how 2D arrays worked was fairly straightforward, I found this assignment in
general very very hard and difficult to get past the core of it.
