Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
The terminal error was coming up even though I did have a try-catch in my code
and it said the error was because of that. However this was not the case and it
ended up being an error in how people were choosing the text file to open.

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
I was much more confident while using scanners as we have used it in earlier assignments.
Therefore when I approached that we had to scan the files and store as an array, even though the
array part was new, I was able to confidently work through the scanners. 

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
I think my completion1 is perhaps throwing a terminal error and I don't know why.
Also I got really stuck on drawing the histogram.
