 * plotNumbers():

 *  Uses an ArrayList. 
 *
 * readAndReverse():
 *      read tokens from file into an ArrayList of Strings
 *      then access values in reverse order
 *  Uses an ArrayList. 
 *
 * sieve():
 *      Make an ArrayList of integers containing 1 .. 100
 *      Let the use choose a number then remove all multiples of it from the list
 *  Uses an ArrayList.
