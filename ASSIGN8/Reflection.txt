Questions for reflection.
=========================


1. What is one error, bug, or exception that you encountered this week? How did
you go about fixing it? Can you think of a way of making it easier to fix next
time?
A terminal window was being thrown due to the move left method and I realised this was because I had
a bit of code that I had made it so that it would try move the card to the left 
even if the selected position was at 0. I added a simple if loop to avoid this. 

2. What is one thing that you did in this assignment that is similar to previous
ones (for assignment one this can include work you did before starting at Vic)?
Was it easier this time? How did you approach doing it?
First time doing array lists so not really something typically similar to previous
assignments. However normal arrays are slightly the same however you can't add or 
remove data on an array - it's set.

3. If you have any other thoughts about the assignment please write them here.
It was a bit tricky. The drawHand method took me days.
